## Where to start

For the moment, existing pages contain only one component each, so we don't really need to separate the page and the component.
You will find the components (=pages) in the /src/app/pages folder.
Later on, if pages are to contain more information, a /components folder will need to be created in addition to the /pages folder, for a better architecture.

- `pages` folder: contains pages components.
- `core` folder: contains the business logic 
- `services` folder: contains the HTTP requests 
- `models` folder: contains the models for the data.

Good luck!
